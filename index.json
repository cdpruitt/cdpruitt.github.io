In keeping with a changing international security environment, each of the last four US administrations has updated the mission of US nuclear forces by preparing a Nuclear Posture Review (NPR). In February, the current administration publicly released its NPR, deviating (in both tone and stated objectives) from the Obama administration NPR in 2010, which itself played down several objectives of the Bush administration NPR of 2002. \n\n In this overview talk, I will examine the protean posture of the United States toward its nuclear weaponry since the end of the Cold War. Besides a summary of the pertinent public facts (e.g., currently-deployed US weapons, status of US nuclear-weapons infrastructure, and treaty obligations), I will discuss new technical developments over the last five years in the United States, Russia, and North Korea that are potentially at odds with all three countries' publicly-affirmed goal of \"complete nuclear disarmament\".","tags":[],"title":"The 2018 Nuclear Posture Review","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1547432772,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1547432772,"objectID":"35c77059cc061d12001c9b349f88cb5e","permalink":"https://cdpruitt.github.io/talk/tamu-sept-2018/","publishdate":"2019-01-13T20:26:12-06:00","relpermalink":"/talk/tamu-sept-2018/","section":"talk","summary":"This is a tag-team seminar: each speaker will present a mini-seminar on recent results from the WU group. \n \n The first mini-seminar will detail recent total neutron cross section measurements on isotopically-separated targets and their role in constraining asymmetry-dependence in optical potentials. Both experimental advances (new digitizer capabilities) that enabled the measurements and the theoretical underpinnings (the Dispersive Optical Model) will be discussed.\n \n In the second mini-seminar, two resonances, one in 9Li and the other in 10Be both found by the invariant mass technique, will be: a) presented and b) explained by the Shell Model Embedded in the Continuum (SMEC) of J. Okolowicz and M. Ploszajczak. What is interesting is that the coupling to the neutron continuum enhances the “ushering” of the resonances to the proton emission threshold.

Since then, regional and global optical models have been developed for a wide variety of projectiles (p, n, alpha, heavy ion, etc.), but most lack sufficient justification in formal many‐body methods. In addition, as phenomenological objects, optical models are only as good as the data they are based on. Thus, given the paucity of high‐energy proton reaction cross section and neutron total cross section data in the literature, their usefulness typically diminishes beyond 100 MeV.\n\n This seminar will present a new digitizer‐enabled approach employed to make a series of neutron total cross section measurements on isotopically‐separated targets across a wide energy range. Coupled with new developments in the Dispersive Optical Model (DOM), which extends traditional optical models to the negative en‐ ergy domain by enforcing a dispersion relation, these new experimental results generate predictions for the neutron skins of O18, Ca48, Ni58, Ni64, Sn112, and Sn124 and help constrain the density dependence of the symmetry energy.","tags":[],"title":"Neutron Total Cross Sections and Neutron Skins","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1446141600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1446141600,"objectID":"c20e2df2f86f93779384681f3f7a8dbc","permalink":"https://cdpruitt.github.io/talk/ultracondensed-science-where-we-come-from/","publishdate":"2015-10-29T12:00:00-06:00","relpermalink":"/talk/ultracondensed-science-where-we-come-from/","section":"talk","summary":"Ever wonder where we really come from?
