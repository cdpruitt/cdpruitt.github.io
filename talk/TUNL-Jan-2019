abstract: The nuclear opƟcal model was developed in the 1950s and 60s in part to explain
neutron total cross secƟon data in a simple, intuiƟve way. Since then, regional and
global opƟcal models have been developed for a wide variety of projecƟles (p, n,
alpha, heavy ion, etc.), but most lack sufficient jusƟficaƟon in formal many‐body
methods. In addiƟon, as phenomenological objects, opƟcal models are only as
good as the data they are based on. Thus, given the paucity of high‐energy proton
reacƟon cross secƟon and neutron total cross secƟon data in the literature, their
usefulness typically diminishes beyond 100 MeV.
This seminar will present a new digiƟzer‐enabled approach employed to make a
series of neutron total cross secƟon measurements on isotopically‐separated tar‐
gets across a wide energy range. Coupled with new developments in the Dispersive
OpƟcal Model (DOM), which extends tradiƟonal opƟcal models to the negaƟve en‐
ergy domain by enforcing a dispersion relaƟon, these new experimental results
generate predicƟons for the neutron skins of O18, Ca48, Ni58, Ni64, Sn112, and
Sn124 and help constrain the density dependence of the symmetry energy.
